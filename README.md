# WPA3-Attack-Detection-ML
Code and data for "A Machine Learning Approach for Detecting WPA3 Downgrade Attacks in Next-Generation Wi-Fi Systems", submitted to PLOS ONE. This repository includes preprocessing scripts, ML-based detection models, and evaluation metrics.

> The study proposes a Machine Learning-based approach (MFST-DAD) for detecting downgrade attacks in WPA3 networks.
 The model uses adaptive feature selection, thresholding, and real-time classification to secure next-generation Wi-Fi systems. 
The method is evaluated using aspecially generated dataset and achieves up to 99.8% detection accuracy.

> This repository supports downgrade attack detection based on CSV inputs.  
> It is structured for clarity, and all stages are modular. Make sure to update file paths as needed.
